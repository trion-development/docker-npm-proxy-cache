= Caching proxy for NPM
Especially useful in CI/CD setups to save bandwith and reduce build times.

== Cache settings
Set to 24h and will deliver possibly stale data in case the upstream registry is not reachable.

== Kubernetes usage
See the `k8s.yaml` example deployment to deploy as a service.

Users of minikube might want to use a NodePort deployment.

Be careful when using the docker daemon of your cluster (minikube) directly for build containers:
Since the container will not be managed by kubernetes, the kubernetes DNS and service discovery won't work.

You must use the IP of your minikube node instead.

== Building the image
As usual run a `docker build -t trion/npm-proxy-cache`.
